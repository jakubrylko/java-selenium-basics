# Selenium Basics with Java
In this project, I would like to share some basic test automation exercises with [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver) and [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java) programming language that I did during the comprehensive software testing course by [Software Development Academy](https://sdacademy.pl), which I completed in 2021.
